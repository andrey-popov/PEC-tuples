PEC-tuples
==========

Code provided in this repository is exploited in some physics analyses performed by the [CMS collaboration](http://cms.web.cern.ch) (CERN). You must be a CMS user to be able to use it.

The repository contains a package for the [CMSSW](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw) environment. It allows to run over the [MiniAOD](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMSPublic/WorkBookMiniAOD) data tier and save relevant reconstructed and generator-level physics objects in a simple [ROOT](https://root.cern.ch) format for subsequent analysis. No dependence on CMSSW is required to read produced files.

Usage instructions are provided in the [wiki](https://github.com/andrey-popov/PEC-tuples/wiki) of the repository. Detailed documentation is provided in code.
